I am a full time Master's student and a Data Science Enthusiast who likes to spend much of the time reading books, watching documentaries and exploring ways to deal with data. This portfolio is to keep track of how I started my journey of setting foot in Data Science and what I am learning as I dive deeper. I am including all the references of Books and links I used in the process. If you want to start with Data science or just do magic with data! and does not know where to start reach me at devayani3196@yahoo.com !
