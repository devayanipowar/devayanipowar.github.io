I am a Data Scientist who spends much of the time exploring ways to deal with data, reading books, and watching documentaries. I have completed my master's in Data Science from George Mason University and right now I am honing my Machine Learning skills for Computer Vision Applications. My favorite Machine Learning model is KNN( the first one I implemented from scratch!)  and my favorite book is The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.
