I am a Data Scientist who spends much of the time exploring ways to deal with data, reading books, and watching documentaries. I came to States two years ago with three bags and one dream to be best at what I do i.e Data Science. Right now, I am honing my Machine Learning and Data Science skills for Computer Vision Applications and I plan to document most of it. I am generally obsessed with philosophy which you can guess by my choice of books - The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.


*"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure." - The Alchemist*
