I am a Data Scientist currently working as a Research Analyst at George Mason University. I recently completed my Masters in Data analytics engineering with a concentration in data mining and have almost 1.5 years of experience working in the Data Science field. I like to spend much of the time exploring ways to deal with data, reading books, and watching documentaries. Right now, I am documenting my perspective about Data Science and why I chose it in the first place. Besides data, I am generally obsessed with philosophy which you can guess by my choice of books - The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. You can find some of my work
